# Bootimage ADB Unsecure / Secure Patcher for Android

## How the project works and what it does
 * Modifies the bootimage ramdisk to set adb properties
    unsecure or secure in single flashable zips

 * Uses [libbootimg for MultiROM](https://github.com/multirom-dev/libbootimg) as bootimage edition tool
 * Also compatible with the Sony ELF boot partitions by using my MultiROM version of the libbootimg
